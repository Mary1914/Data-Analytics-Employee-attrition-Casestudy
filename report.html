<h1>Attrition / Churn Analysis – Detailed Report</h1>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This case study analyses churn/attrition patterns using Power BI to identify key drivers behind customers leaving
    and to highlight areas where retention efforts should be focused.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dashboard shows a churn rate of around <strong>26.86%</strong>. The strongest churn signals appear around
    <strong>contract type</strong>, <strong>customer groups</strong>, <strong>age segments</strong>, and
    <strong>account length</strong>. Based on these findings, the recommendations focus on improving retention for
    month-to-month customers, strengthening early-lifecycle engagement, and reducing churn caused by dissatisfaction and price sensitivity.

<h2>Key Insights (What the dashboards show)</h2>

<h3>1) Overall churn level is significant</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The churn rate is approximately <strong>26.86%</strong>.</li>
  <li>This means roughly <strong>1 in 4</strong> customers are leaving, which is a high business risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Contract type is a major churn driver</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Month-to-month</strong> customers show the highest churn.</li>
  <li><strong>Yearly contracts</strong> show much lower churn, which indicates contract stability improves retention.</li>
  <li>This suggests churn can be reduced by moving more customers from monthly → longer plans.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) “Competitor” and “dissatisfaction/price” dominate churn reasons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Competitor-related reasons are the top contributors, meaning customers are switching providers.</li>
  <li>Price and dissatisfaction also appear repeatedly, suggesting value perception issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Age segments show different churn behaviour</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Churn patterns vary by age group, which means one retention strategy will not fit everyone.</li>
  <li>Targeted retention campaigns by age segment (offers, messaging, service improvements) will be more effective.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) Account length matters (early-stage churn is a key risk)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Churn trends change across account length.</li>
  <li>This is a signal that <strong>early customer experience</strong> (first months) is critical.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Recommendations (Actionable and business-focused)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduce month-to-month churn:</strong> offer incentives to move monthly customers to 12–24 month plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Early retention program:</strong> create an onboarding/engagement flow for the first 1–3 months (check-ins, discounts, proactive support).</li>
  <li><strong>Competitor defence strategy:</strong> identify customers with churn risk signals and offer targeted retention deals before they leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Address price & dissatisfaction:</strong> review pricing tiers, improve service quality, and provide clearer value communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Segment-based campaigns:</strong> tailor messaging and offers by age group and customer category.</li>
</ul>
