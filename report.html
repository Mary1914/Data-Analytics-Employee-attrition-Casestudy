  <h2>Dashboard Analysis</h2>

<p>
The dashboard provides a high-level and detailed view of employee attrition across
multiple dimensions, including department, job role, contract type, and geography.
</p>

<h3>Overall Attrition Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The overall attrition rate is <strong>26.86%</strong>, indicating that more than one in four employees have left.</li>
  <li>A total of <strong>6,687 employees</strong> were analysed, out of which <strong>1,796 employees</strong> churned.</li>
  <li>This level of attrition represents a significant risk to workforce stability and productivity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Drivers of Attrition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Competitive offers from other companies are the leading cause of attrition.</li>
  <li>Service-related factors such as support attitude and employee dissatisfaction contribute heavily.</li>
  <li>Salary levels and years at the company have a noticeable impact on retention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contract Type Impact</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Employees on <strong>month-to-month contracts</strong> show the highest attrition.</li>
  <li>Longer-term contracts (one-year and two-year) demonstrate lower churn rates.</li>
  <li>This suggests that contract stability plays a key role in employee retention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geographic Trends</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attrition is not evenly distributed across regions.</li>
  <li>Specific states show consistently higher attrition rates.</li>
  <li>Regional factors such as local competition and employment opportunities may influence turnover.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Promote long-term contracts:</strong> Encourage employees to move from month-to-month arrangements to longer contracts through incentives.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve employee experience:</strong> Focus on improving support quality, manager engagement, and workplace satisfaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Review compensation strategy:</strong> Conduct regular salary benchmarking to remain competitive in high-risk roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Target high-attrition regions:</strong> Implement focused retention initiatives in states with consistently higher churn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This analysis highlights that employee attrition is driven by a combination of
competitive pressures, employee experience, and contract structure.
By addressing these areas, organisations can significantly reduce turnover
and improve long-term workforce stability.
